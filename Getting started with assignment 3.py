# - networkNLjunctions.gml really has the exact same structure as networkAssignment.gml,
#   but it contains ALL junctions and links in the Netherlands, not just the selected area.
# - networkNLcomplete.gml also contains the map of the Netherlands, but has MANY more junctions
#   and links. It does contain the actual graphical layout of all the roads, as you can see in the plot.
